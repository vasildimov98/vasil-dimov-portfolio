        <h2 class="heading-secondary">01. About me</h2>

        <p class="about__text paragraph u-margin-top-small">
            As a college student, I studied business and found it interesting, but something was missing. One day, I
            came across a free programming course and decided to try it out. As I began to learn about coding, I
            became
            fascinated by the problem-solving and logical thinking involved.
        </p>
        <p class="about__text paragraph u-margin-top-small">
            While completing my bachelor's degree, I continued to study programming in my free time. I took courses
            and
            taught myself different programming languages, determined to turn my newfound passion into a career.
        </p>
        <p class="about__text paragraph u-margin-top-small">
            After graduation, I continued to learn and hone my skills. Although I had no professional experience at
            the
            time, I was determined to become a software engineer. I worked hard, never giving up on my dream.
        </p>
        <p class="about__text paragraph u-margin-top-small">
            Eventually, my dedication paid off, and I landed my first job as a software engineer. Although I am
            still
            relatively new to the field, I have gained valuable experience working on various projects, each one
            challenging me to become a better programmer.
        </p>
        <p class="about__text paragraph u-margin-top-small">
            Recently, I created a personal website to showcase my work and projects. It's a platform where I can
            share
            my passion for software engineering with others and demonstrate what I've learned along the way. Despite
            the
            challenges that come with being a software engineer, I know that I made the right decision by following
            my
            passion and pursuing a career in this field.
